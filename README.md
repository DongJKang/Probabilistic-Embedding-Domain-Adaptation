# Probabilistic Embedding Domain Adaptation
This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of a probabilistic embedding-based domain adaptation framework. The approach aims to enhance model generalization across different domains by leveraging probabilistic embeddings and unsupervised domain adaptation.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DongJKang/Probabilistic-Embedding-Domain-Adaptation.git
cd Probabilistic-Embedding-Domain-Adaptation
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install depenedencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

1. Configure the experiment:
* Modify the configuration files in the `configs/` directory to set up your experiment parameters.

2. Run training:
```bash
python main.py --config configs/your_config.yaml
```

3. Monitor training:
* Training logs and checkpoints will be saved in the `logs/` directory.
